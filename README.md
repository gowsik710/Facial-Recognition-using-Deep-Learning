# Facial-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning
Facial recognition is a biometric alternative that measures unique characteristics of a human face. Applications available today include flight check in, tagging friends and family members in photos, and tailored advertising. The goal of the project is to develop a facial recognition programme with Deep Convolutional Neural Network. The project is completed successfully with a testing prediction accuracy of 94%
